Task 4 - Build a dashboard
Here you are expected to build a dashboard using streamlit, Flask or any other platform.


Some useful steps to do that is as follows
Install mysql community (download here) and create a database
Write an sql file (schema ) that creates Tables IF Not Exists, Drop Tables
Insert / Update Data into the created Tables and Databases above.
Read data from the tables and display it on streamlit.
The web app should have two pages or more and selection of the data to be displayed e.g show data belonging from a particular user
Design different plots that show different analyses of the data.
